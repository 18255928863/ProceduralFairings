3.02
[*]Updated KSPAPIExtensions, should work with Procedural Parts now.
[*]A bit less restrictive tech, allowing sizes a bit larger and smaller than stock ones.
[*]Trying to avoid moving attached parts after loading design or saved game.
[*]Fixed wrong size of newly added side nodes.

3.01
[*]Updated KSPAPIExtensions.
[*]Added size step parameters for RSS.

3.00
[*]Moved files up to GameData folder (no Keramzit folder anymore). Make sure to delete old mod before installing (which is a good practice anyway).
[*]Added new resizable fairing bases with configurable number of side nodes.
[*]Old parts (bases and adapter) are deprecated. Launched vessels should be fine, but you might have trouble loading old designs in VAB/SPH in career mode.
[*]Added new part: Thrust Plate Multi-Adapter.
[*]Using KSPAPIExtensions for better tweakables.
[*]Removed old keyboard-based tweaks - use new tweakables.
[*]Tweaking outer diameter (with fairings), instead of inner radius.
[*]Added fairing decoupler torque tweakable.
[*]Side nodes (for attaching fairings) get larger with the base size to make them more sturdy in KSP 0.23.5+
[*]Tech limits are not checked in sandbox mode anymore.
[*]Extra payload radius is now zero by default.
[*]Fixed interstage adapter decoupling with fuselage fairings.

2.4.4
[*]Added tweakables.
[*]Rearranged tech tree, added 3.75m and 5m parts.
[*]Interstage adapter is available earlier now, but its radius is limited by aerodynamics tech.
[*]Launch clamps are ignored in payload scanning now.
[*]Payload scanning doesn't follow surface attachment to the parent part anymore.
[*]Improved interstage fairing shape when its top is inside payload.
[*]Added base cone angle limit to make fairings look better.
[*]Part descriptions and readme text copy edited by Duxwing.

2.4.3
[*]Improved payload scanning for interstage adapter.
[*]Recompiled for KSP 0.23.

2.4.2
[*]Zero-radius payload is now used when no payload attached, so fairings will always reshape.
[*]Added parts to the tech tree.
[*]Moved fuselage shrouds to Structural tab.
[*]Changing adapter attachment node size with radius.

2.4.1
[*]Disabled fuel crossfeed on the interstage adapter - enable at your own risk, it confuses Engineer Redux to death.
[*]Added stock decoupler module to the interstage adapter topmost node to help with delta-v calculations.
[*]Improved fairing shape for interstage adapter when fairing top is inside payload.

2.4
[*]Added procedural interstage fairing adapter with adjustable radii and height which decouples from the top part when fairings are ejected.
[*]Added conic fuselage.
[*]Fixed another inline fairing shape bug.

2.3
[*]Changed fuselage texture to distinguish it from fairings.
[*]You can now lock fairing shape: mouse over the side fairing/fuselage and press L.
[*]Reduced side nodes size for smaller base rings and 0.625m fairing base (for easier placement).
[*]Fixed inline fairings making a top cone when there should be just a cylinder.

2.2
[*]Added experimental egg-shaped fuselage (a side fairing without decoupler).
[*]Moved fairing decoupler code to separate PartModule.
[*]Auto-struts are now created between the top inline base and side fairings as well. NOTE: if you payload is wobbly, the sides might still wobble.
[*]Fixed bug with misplaced fairings on new ring bases.

2.1
[*]Added low-profile fairing bases (base rings), intended for inline fairings. All of them have 4 side fairing attachment points.
[*]Replaced base model with one that looks more lightweight. It has the same size etc., so it won't break your existing ships.
[*]You can now toggle fuel crossfeed for fairing base: mouse over and press G in editor or use right-click menu in flight.
[*]You can now disable auto-struts between side fairings: mouse over the base and press T.
[*]Fixed inline fairings not connecting with the top base sometimes.
[*]Fixed nested inline fairings not connecting to the proper base.
[*]Fairing outline (blue lines) is not displayed now for inline fairings if sides are attached to any of the two bases.

2.0
[*]Inline truncated fairings are now created between two bases (one must be flipped). It won't work properly for off-center bases. If you want it off-center, tell me what for and how it should look.
[*]You can now change ejection force by pressing F when mouse is over the side fairing.
[*]Fixed rapid unplanned disassembly of side fairings when going out of time warp sometimes.

1.3
[*]Fixed ejection direction bug - it shouldn't matter how you place fairings now.

1.2
[*]Added invisible automatically placed struts between side fairings to mostly eliminate wobble.
[*]Replaced ejectionNoseDv with ejectionTorque so that all ejected fairings have the same motion, regardless of shape.
[*]Improved payload scanning for better fitting of mesh and box colliders.
[*]You can now adjust radius by moving the mouse over the base part while holding R (the default key, can be changed in part .cfg).
[*]Fixed "recursion" bug which caused misplaced fairings to grow out of control. (It's also a foundation for future inline fairings).
[*]Using a (hopefully) better method to offset side fairing center of mass.
[*]Using proportionally smaller part of texture for 1/3 (and smaller) side fairings to reduce texture stretching.
[*]Renamed "capsule-shaped" fairings to "egg-shaped" to be more Kerbal.

1.1
[*]Fix for future FAR compatibility (needs fixed FAR version to actually work).
[*]Less rotation on eject to reduce collisions with payload and lower stages.
[*]Conic side fairings added, original ones are made a bit more capsule-shaped.

1.0
[*]Initial release.
